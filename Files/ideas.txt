Game
* Does not require a goal to start with
* First dev goal does not require armies
* Over population can cause riots and people die, output drops
* Entities, such as oilwell requires people
* If people unhappy they do not breed - population will decline
* 1 day = 1 month
* After 60-80 days people die
* People pay tax, user has money
* Start with 20 people?
* System is based on events and ticks - a tick happens every 1 minute which checks events, triggers them and then finishes its process
* Aim is to make the civilisation "stable" so can leave for long time
* If not stable everyone will die + have to start again on a new island
* Discovery ships need to claim land/discover land before any other ships can go there


starting the game (first 12 hours)
* Start with 20 people
* Make 1 wood farm (2 staff)
	= Get wood to make iron mine
* Make 1 iron mine (4 staff)
	= Get iron to make shipping yard
* Make shipping yard (6 staff)
	= Can now make a simple discovery boat (level=1, type=discovery, people=2)
* Make discovery level 1 boat (2 staff)
	.. 14 people used
	.. 6 people unemployed
* Try and find another island
	= if found another island can stamp name on it (because discovery ship)



Map Generation

lng lat based on squared areas
islands cannot be <3 squares close
each new user is at least 30 squares away from anyone else



Entities

* Person
	- name
	- works at - they never leave where they work unless they die (keeps it easier)
	- sex
	- age
	- house lives in
	- breed with (another opposite sex person)
	- happyness level (-10 to +10)
	- happyness reasons (more than one reason, might be happy or be sad because no jobs, no food, no wife)
	- intelligence (1-10) - also depends what jobs they can get, dumber people are more happy
	- total job score (1-10)
	- pays tax based on job score, higher level the more tax they pay = more money user makes

* House
	- someone lives here
	- total space / 2 = number of people that can live there

* Mines / Oilwells
	- levels (1-5), higher the number the more output and the more jobs
	- job score (4 - low)
	- requires people
	- more people = more output
	- output
	- maximum number of people
	- materials required to build (level 1 = just wood)
	- if stockpile full then cannot mine

* Farms 
	- levels (1-5), higher the number the more output and the more jobs
	- job score (3 - low)
	- type of farm, animal, crops, wood*
	- output (based on each person)
	- maybe farms just keep people happy

* Shipyard
	- levels (1-5), higher the number the quicker output for a ship and the better level of ship can be made
	- job score (5 - medium)
	- build ships
	- people work here

* Stockpile
	- holds resources
	- space
	- amount of resources can be held

* Ship
	- type of ship, spy, discovery/expedition, war, collonisation
	- level of ship (1-20)
	- can hold people, number depending on type of ship
	- level of ship
	- speed per hour (how many squares per hour)
	- location x/y
	- destination x/y
	- mission (depends on the type of ship)
	- build time in hours
	- attack value
	- defense value
	- materials, requires materials to build ship, e.g. iron, wood
	- maximum distance (based on type and level of ship)


Other ideas
* The more jobs available the more chance of people breeding
* Defence
* Barracks - turn people into Soilders, good job
* Science/researcher - to discover more modern (higher level) ships?
* Natural disasters - "stuns" peoples happyness for a time, kills people, etc...
* Random names for islands
* Islands that are inhibatible but have lots of resources on them, e.g. a rock island, normally just 1 cell big
* Some islands can be either very rich and low in some resources or just very low in all resources
* Weather


Jobs
* Naval
* Marine
* Mine worker
* Oil rigger
* Farmer
* Shipyarder



Happyness
* Hunger
* OVer population
* Not enough jobs



Islands
* Owned by
* Discovered by
* Random resources per island, resources will "run out". When they run out the output is at a fixed low value, so its possible with time to recover
* All islands have all the same resources but in different amounts
* Random amount of space on island (size of available space on island)
* Maximum population, each entity (e.g. person, mine) has a "spaced used", person=1, house=10, oilwell=20, coalmine=25
* Can name the island
* Islands belong to a user
* Islands can be taken over by other people


Events
* Add events (for each tick)
	- Build level 3 transport ship
	- Send ship #123 to x/y
	- Breed child
	- Build oilwell
	- Natural disaster - reduce % of peoples happyness for a certain amount of time


Armies



Ideas
* Discover islands - all islands are hidden until you discover them with ships
* Mining - build mining industries to mine resources
